It's ok. It'll be solved as we run the backend service correctly.

# run the backend

## 1. install PostgresSQL and Redis

- go to this path: `/.docker/dev`
- copy `.env.example` and rename it as `.env`
- change database connection information in `.env`
- copy `compose.yml.example` and rename it as `compose.yml`
- run `docker compose -f ./.docker/dev/compose.yml up -d` to start those two containers

- after that, you can check your docker container by `docker ps`, you'll see two processes as follow:

## 2. check database connection

You can use any tools to do the connection test, for this document, we'll use TablePlus:

1. open TablePlus, create a connection:

2. input connection information as in the `.env` file

It'll turn green if the connection working fine.

## 3. data initialization

- go to this path: `/packages/backend/server`
- copy `.env.example` and rename it as `.env`
- As for now, only `DATABASE_URL` should be clarified
- back to root path, run the command below to initialize the database:
  ```sh
  yarn affine server init
  ```
- after that, you'll see tables and functions in database:

## 4. run the backend service

```
yarn run dev
```

if everything works fine, it'll show like this:

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/a1exsun/file@main//hexo/20250424201451791.png)

choose `@affine/server`

there'll be some server logs showed in terminal:
